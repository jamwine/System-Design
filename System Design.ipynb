    "### Relational Database\n",
    "A type of **structured database** in which data is stored following a **tabular** format; often supports powerful querying using SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **row** contains all the information about one entity and each **column** contains all the separate data points. Some of the most popular relational databases are MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, SQLite, Postgres, and MariaDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "In relational databases, each record conforms to a **fixed schema**, meaning the columns must be decided and chosen before data entry and each row must have data for each column. The schema can be altered later, but it involves modifying the whole database and going offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most common situations, SQL databases are **vertically scalable**, i.e., by increasing the horsepower (higher Memory, CPU, etc.) of the hardware, which can get very expensive. It is possible to scale a relational database across multiple servers, but this is a challenging and time-consuming process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Relational Database\n",
    "In contrast with relational database (SQL databases), a type of database that is free of imposed, tabular-like structure. Non-relational databases are often referred to as **NoSQL databases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NoSQL, schemas are **dynamic**. Columns can be added on the fly and each `row` (or equivalent) doesn’t have to contain data for each `column`.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are **horizontally scalable**, meaning we can add more servers easily in our NoSQL database infrastructure to handle a lot of traffic. Any cheap commodity hardware or cloud instances can host NoSQL databases, thus making it a lot more cost-effective than vertical scaling. A lot of NoSQL technologies also distribute data across servers automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL\n",
    "**Structured Query Language**. Relational databases can be used using a derivative of SQL such as PostgreSQL in the case of Postgres.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Any database that supports SQL. This term is often used synonymously with **Relational Database**, though in practice, not every relational database supports SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NoSQL Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Any database that is not SQL-compatible is called **NoSQL**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ACID Transaction\n",
    "A type of database transaction that has four important properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Atomicity**: The operations that constitute the transaction will either all succeed or all fail. There is no in-between state.\n",
    "* **Consistency**: The transaction cannot bring the database to an invalid state. After the transaction is committed or rolled back, the rules for each record will still apply, and all future transactions will see the effect of the transaction. Also named **Strong Consistency**.\n",
    "* **Isolation**: The execution of multiple transactions concurrently will have the same effect as if they had been executed sequentially.\n",
    "* **Durability**: Any committed transaction is written to non-volatile storage. It will not be undone by a crash, power loss, or network partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vast majority of relational databases are **ACID compliant**. So, when it comes to data reliability and safe guarantee of performing transactions, SQL databases are still the better bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the NoSQL solutions sacrifice ACID compliance for performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Index\n",
    "\n",
    "A special auxiliary **data structure** that allows our database to perform certain queries much faster. Indexes can typically only exist to reference structured data, like data stored in relational databases. In practice, we create an index on one or multiple columns in our database to greatly speed up read queries that we run very often, with the downside of slightly longer writes to our database, since writes have to also take place in the relevant index.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **index** is a data structure that can be perceived as a table of contents that points us to the location where actual data lives. So when we create an index on a column of a table, we store that column and a pointer to the whole row in the index. Let’s assume a table containing a list of books, the following diagram shows how an index on the `Title` column looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='imgs/index.png' alt='index' width=500 height=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a traditional relational data store, we can also apply this concept to larger datasets. The trick with indexes is that we must carefully consider how users will access the data. In the case of data sets that are many terabytes in size, but have very **small payloads** (e.g., 1 KB), indexes are a necessity for optimizing data access. Finding a small payload in such a large dataset can be a real challenge, since we can’t possibly iterate over that much data in any reasonable time. Furthermore, it is very likely that such a large data set is spread over several physical devices—this means we need some way to find the correct physical location of the desired data. Indexes are the best way to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indexes decrease write performance\n",
    "An index can dramatically speed up data retrieval but may itself be large due to the additional keys, which slow down data insertion & update.\n",
    "\n",
    "When adding rows or making updates to existing rows for a table with an active index, we not only have to write the data but also have to update the index. This will decrease the write performance. This performance degradation applies to all insert, update, and delete operations for the table. For this reason, adding unnecessary indexes on tables should be avoided and indexes that are no longer used should be removed. To reiterate, adding indexes is about improving the performance of search queries. If the goal of the database is to provide a data store that is often written to and rarely read from, in that case, decreasing the performance of the more common operation, which is writing, is probably not worth the increase in performance we get from reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strong Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong Consistency usually refers to the consistency of ACID transactions, as opposed to Eventual Consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eventual Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "A consistency model which is unlike Strong Consistency. In this model, reads might return a view of the system that is stale. An eventually consistent datastore will give guarantees that the state of the database will eventually reflect writes within a time period (could be 10 seconds, or minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Postgres\n",
    "\n",
    "A relational database that uses a dialect of SQL called PostgreSQL. Provides ACID transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Lock\n",
    "\n",
    "In a relational database that provides ACID transactions, updating rows inside a table will cause a **lock** to be held on that table or on the rows we are updating. If a second transaction tries to update the same rows, it will block before the update until the first transaction releases that lock. This is one of the core mechanisms behind the **Atomicity** of ACID transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Selection\n",
    "Here are a few reasons to choose a **SQL database**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need to ensure **ACID compliance**. ACID compliance reduces anomalies and protects the integrity of our database by prescribing exactly how transactions interact with the database. Generally, NoSQL databases sacrifice ACID compliance for scalability and processing speed, but for many e-commerce and financial applications, an ACID-compliant database remains the preferred option.\n",
    "* Our data is **structured** and **unchanging**. If our business is not experiencing massive growth that would require more servers and if we’re only working with data that is **consistent**, then there may be no reason to use a system designed to support a variety of data types and high traffic volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons to use **NoSQL database** are:\n",
    "* When all the other components of our application are fast and seamless, NoSQL databases prevent data from being the bottleneck. Big data is contributing to a large success for NoSQL databases, mainly because it handles data differently than the traditional relational databases. A few popular examples of NoSQL databases are MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, and HBase.\n",
    "* Storing large volumes of data that often have little to no structure. A NoSQL database sets no limits on the types of data we can store together and allows us to add new types as the need changes. With document-based databases, we can store data in one place without having to define what `types` of data those are in advance.\n",
    "* Making the most of cloud computing and storage. Cloud-based storage is an excellent cost-saving solution but requires data to be easily spread across multiple servers to scale up. Using commodity (affordable, smaller) hardware on-site or in the cloud saves you the hassle of additional software and NoSQL databases like Cassandra are designed to be scaled across multiple data centers out of the box, without a lot of headaches.\n",
    "* Rapid development. NoSQL is extremely useful for rapid development as it doesn’t need to be prepped ahead of time. If we’re working on quick iterations of our system which require making frequent updates to the data structure without a lot of downtime between versions, a relational database will slow us down."

    "\n",
    "A piece of hardware or software that stores data, typically meant to retrieve that data faster than otherwise. Caches take advantage of the locality of reference principle: recently requested data is likely to be requested again. They are used in almost every computing layer: hardware, operating systems, web browsers, web applications, and more. A cache is like **short-term memory**: it has a limited amount of space, but is typically faster than the original data source and contains the most recently accessed items. Caches can exist at all levels in architecture, but are often found at the level nearest to the front end, where they are implemented to return data quickly without taxing downstream levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caches are often used to store responses to network requests as well as results of computationally-long operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that data in a cache can become **stale** if the main source of truth for that data (ie, the main database behind the cache) gets updated and the cache doesn't.\n",

    "### Cache Hit\n",
    "\n",
    "When requested data is found in a cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cache Miss\n",
    "\n",
    "When requested data could have been found in a cache but isn't. This is typically used to refer to a negative consequence of a system failure or of a poor design choice. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a server goes down, our load balancer will have to forward requests to a new server, which will result in cache misses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cache Invalidation\n",
    "While caching is fantastic, it requires some maintenance to keep the cache coherent with the source of truth (e.g., database). If the data is modified in the database, it should be invalidated in the cache; if not, this can cause inconsistent application behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this problem is known as cache invalidation; there are three main schemes that are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write-through cache**: Under this scheme, data is written into the cache and the corresponding database simultaneously. The cached data allows for fast retrieval and, since the same data gets written in the permanent storage, we will have complete data consistency between the cache and the storage. Also, this scheme ensures that nothing will get lost in case of a crash, power failure, or other system disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although, write-through minimizes the risk of data loss, since every write operation must be done twice before returning success to the client, this scheme has the disadvantage of higher latency for write operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write-around cache**: This technique is similar to write-through cache, but data is written directly to permanent storage, bypassing the cache. This can reduce the cache being flooded with write operations that will not subsequently be re-read, but has the disadvantage that a read request for recently written data will create a “cache miss” and must be read from slower back-end storage and experience higher latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write-back cache**: Under this scheme, data is written to cache alone, and completion is immediately confirmed to the client. The write to the permanent storage is done after specified intervals or under certain conditions. This results in low-latency and high-throughput for write-intensive applications; however, this speed comes with the risk of data loss in case of a crash or other adverse event because the only copy of the written data is in the cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cache Eviction Policy\n",

    "The policy by which values get evicted or removed from a cache. Popular cache eviction policies include **LRU** (**least-recently used**), **FIFO** (**first in first out**), and **LFU** (**least-frequently used**). Following are some of the most common cache eviction policies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **First In First Out (FIFO)**: The cache evicts the first block accessed first without any regard to how often or how many times it was accessed before.\n",

    "\n",
    "A function that takes in a specific data type (such as a string or an identifier) and outputs a number. Different inputs may have the same output, but a good hashing function attempts to minimize those **hashing collisions** (which is equivalent to maximizing uniformity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consistent Hashing\n",
    "A type of hashing that minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped when a hash table gets resized. It's often used by load balancers to distribute traffic to servers; it minimizes the number of requests that get forwarded to different servers when new servers are added or when existing servers are brought down.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distributed Hash Table (DHT)** is one of the fundamental components used in distributed scalable systems. Hash Tables need a key, a value, and a hash function where hash function maps the key to a location where the value is stored.\n",

    "$$index = hash\\_function(key)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are designing a distributed caching system. Given `n` cache servers, an intuitive hash function would be `key % n`. It is simple and commonly used. But it has two major drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is NOT horizontally scalable. Whenever a new cache host is added to the system, all existing mappings are broken. It will be a pain point in maintenance if the caching system contains lots of data. Practically, it becomes difficult to schedule a downtime to update all caching mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It may NOT be load balanced, especially for non-uniformly distributed data. In practice, it can be easily assumed that the data will not be distributed uniformly. For the caching system, it translates into some caches becoming hot and saturated while the others idle and are almost empty.\n",

    "\n",
    "In such situations, consistent hashing is a good way to improve the caching system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consistent hashing** is a very useful strategy for distributed caching systems and DHTs. It allows us to distribute data across a cluster in such a way that will minimize reorganization when nodes are added or removed. Hence, the caching system will be easier to scale up or scale down.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Consistent Hashing, when the hash table is resized (e.g. a new cache host is added to the system), only `k/n` keys need to be remapped where `k` is the `total number of keys` and `n` is the `total number of servers`. Recall that in a caching system using the `mod` as the hash function, all keys need to be remapped.\n",

To handle this issue, we add `virtual replicas` for caches. Instead of mapping each cache to a single point on the ring, we map it to multiple points on the ring, i.e. **replicas**. This way, each cache is associated with multiple portions of the ring. \n",

For example, if there is only one copy of a file stored on a single server, then losing that server means losing the file. Since losing data is seldom a good thing, we can create duplicate or redundant copies of the file to solve this problem.\n",

    "### Open Proxy \n",
    "An **open proxy** is a proxy server that is accessible by any Internet user. Generally, a proxy server only allows users within a network group (i.e. a closed proxy) to store and forward Internet services such as DNS or web pages to reduce and control the bandwidth used by the group. With an open proxy, however, any user on the Internet is able to use this forwarding service. There two famous open proxy types:\n",

    "A type of **reverse proxy** that distributes traffic across servers. Load balancers can be found in many parts of a system, from the DNS layer all the way to the database layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Load Balancer (LB)** is another critical component of any distributed system. It helps to spread the traffic across a cluster of servers to improve responsiveness and availability of applications, websites or databases. LB also keeps track of the status of all the resources while distributing requests. If a server is not available to take new requests or is not responding or has elevated error rate, LB will stop sending traffic to such a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically a load balancer sits between the client and the server accepting incoming network and application traffic and distributing the traffic across multiple backend servers using various algorithms. By balancing application requests across multiple servers, a load balancer reduces individual server load and prevents any one application server from becoming a single point of failure, thus improving overall application availability and responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='imgs/lb1.png' alt='lb1' width=600 height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "To utilize full scalability and redundancy, we can try to balance the load at each layer of the system. We can add LBs at three places:\n",

    "### Benefits of Load Balancing\n",
    "* Users experience faster, uninterrupted service. Users won’t have to wait for a single struggling server to finish its previous tasks. Instead, their requests are immediately passed on to a more readily available resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Service providers experience less downtime and higher throughput. Even a full server failure won’t affect the end user experience as the load balancer will simply route around it to a healthy server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load balancing makes it easier for system administrators to handle incoming requests while decreasing wait time for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Smart load balancers provide benefits like predictive analytics that determine traffic bottlenecks before they happen. As a result, the smart load balancer gives an organization actionable insights. These are key to automation and can help drive business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* System administrators experience fewer failed or stressed components. Instead of a single device performing a lot of work, load balancing has several devices perform a little bit of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application server cache\n",
    "Placing a cache directly on a request layer node enables the local storage of response data. Each time a request is made to the service, the node will quickly return locally cached data if it exists. If it is not in the cache, the requesting node will fetch the data from the disk. The cache on one request layer node could also be located both in memory (which is very fast) and on the node’s local disk (faster than going to network storage).\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when we expand this to many nodes? If the request layer is expanded to multiple nodes, it’s still quite possible to have each node host its own cache. However, if our load balancer randomly distributes requests across the nodes, the same request will go to different nodes, thus increasing **cache misses**. Two choices for overcoming this hurdle are **global caches** and **distributed caches**."

    "#### How does the load balancer choose the backend server?\n",
    "Load balancers consider two factors before forwarding a request to a backend server. They will first ensure that the server they choose is actually responding appropriately to requests and then use a pre-configured algorithm to select one from the set of healthy servers. We will discuss these algorithms shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Health Checks\n",
    "Load balancers should only forward traffic to `healthy` backend servers. To monitor the health of a backend server, **health checks** regularly attempt to connect to backend servers to ensure that servers are listening. If a server fails a health check, it is automatically removed from the pool, and traffic will not be forwarded to it until it responds to the health checks again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server-Selection Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "How a load balancer chooses servers when distributing traffic amongst multiple servers. Commonly used strategies include **round robin, random selection, performance-based selection** (choosing the server with the best performance metrics, like the fastest response time or the least amount of traffic), and **IP-based routing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a variety of load balancing methods, which use different algorithms for different needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Least Connection Method** — This method directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections. This approach is quite useful when there are a large number of persistent client connections which are unevenly distributed between the servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Least Response Time Method** — This algorithm directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections and the lowest average response time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Least Bandwidth Method** - This method selects the server that is currently serving the least amount of traffic measured in megabits per second (Mbps).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Round Robin Method** — This method cycles through a list of servers and sends each new request to the next server. When it reaches the end of the list, it starts over at the beginning. It is most useful when the servers are of equal specification and there are not many persistent connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Weighted Round Robin Method** — The weighted round-robin scheduling is designed to better handle servers with different processing capacities. Each server is assigned a weight (an integer value that indicates the processing capacity). Servers with higher weights receive new connections before those with less weights and servers with higher weights get more connections than those with less weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **IP Hash** — Under this method, a hash of the IP address of the client is calculated to redirect the request to a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hot Spot\n",
    "When distributing a workload across a set of servers, that workload might be spread unevenly. This can happen if our **sharding key** or our **hashing function** are suboptimal, or if our workload is naturally skewed: some servers will receive a lot more traffic than others, thus creating a **hot spot**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Redundant Load Balancers\n",
    "The load balancer can be a single point of failure; to overcome this, a second load balancer can be connected to the first to form a cluster. Each LB monitors the health of the other and, since both of them are equally capable of serving traffic and failure detection, in the event the main load balancer fails, the second load balancer takes over."

    "### SSL\n",
    "**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)** is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. SSL traffic is often decrypted at the load balancer. When a load balancer decrypts traffic before passing the request on, it is called **SSL termination**. The load balancer saves the web servers from having to expend the extra CPU cycles required for decryption. This improves application performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, SSL termination comes with a security concern. The traffic between the load balancers and the web servers is no longer encrypted. This can expose the application to possible attack. However, the risk is lessened when the load balancer is within the same data center as the web servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another solution is the **SSL pass-through**. The load balancer merely passes an encrypted request to the web server. Then the web server does the decryption. This uses more CPU power on the web server. But organizations that require extra security may find the extra overhead worthwhile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load Balancing and Security\n",
    "Load Balancing plays an important security role as computing moves evermore to the cloud. The off-loading function of a load balancer defends an organization against **distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks**. It does this by shifting attack traffic from the corporate server to a public cloud provider. DDoS attacks represent a large portion of cybercrime as their number and size continues to rise. Hardware defense, such as a perimeter firewall, can be costly and require significant maintenance. Software load balancers with cloud offload provide efficient and cost-effective protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DNS Load Balancing vs Hardware Load Balancing\n",
    "**DNS load balancing** is a software-defined approach to load balancing where client requests to a domain within the **Domain Name System (DNS)** are distributed across different server machines. The DNS system sends a different version of the list of IP addresses each time it responds to a new client request using the **round-robin method**, therefore distributing the DNS requests evenly to different servers to handle the overall load. This in turn provides DNS load balancing failover protection through automatic removal of non-responsive servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS load balancing differs from hardware load balancing in a few instances, although both can be a very effective solution for distributing traffic. One main advantage of DNS level load balancing is the scalability and price. A DNS load balancer distributes traffic to several different IP addresses, whereas the hardware solution uses a single IP address and splits traffic leading to it on multiple servers. As for pricing, hardware load balancers require a large upfront cost whereas DNS load balancers can be scaled as needed.\n",

    "A **distributed system** is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another from any system. The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. Key characteristics of a distributed system include Scalability, Reliability, Availability, Efficiency, and Manageability.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='imgs/distributed_system.png' alt='vshs' width=500 height=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalability\n",
    "**Scalability** is the capability of a system, process, or a network to grow and manage increased demand. Any distributed system that can continuously evolve in order to support the growing amount of work is considered to be scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A system may have to scale because of many reasons like increased data volume or increased amount of work, e.g., number of transactions. A scalable system would like to achieve this scaling without performance loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the performance of a system, although designed (or claimed) to be scalable, declines with the system size due to the management or environment cost. For instance, network speed may become slower because machines tend to be far apart from one another. More generally, some tasks may not be distributed, either because of their inherent atomic nature or because of some flaw in the system design. At some point, such tasks would limit the speed-up obtained by distribution. A scalable architecture avoids this situation and attempts to balance the load on all the participating nodes evenly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling\n",
    "**Horizontal scaling** means that we scale by adding more servers into our pool of resources whereas **Vertical scaling** means that we scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM, Storage, etc.) to an existing server.\n",
    "\n",
    "With horizontal-scaling it is often easier to scale dynamically by adding more machines into the existing pool; Vertical-scaling is usually limited to the capacity of a single server and scaling beyond that capacity often involves downtime and comes with an upper limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good examples of horizontal scaling are **Cassandra** and **MongoDB** as they both provide an easy way to scale horizontally by adding more machines to meet growing needs. Similarly, a good example of vertical scaling is **MySQL** as it allows for an easy way to scale vertically by switching from smaller to bigger machines. However, this process often involves downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='imgs/vshs.png' alt='vshs' width=400 height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reliability\n",
    "**Reliability** is the probability a system will fail in a given period. In simple terms, a distributed system is considered reliable if it keeps delivering its services even when one or several of its software or hardware components fail. Reliability represents one of the main characteristics of any distributed system, since in such systems any failing machine can always be replaced by another healthy one, ensuring the completion of the requested task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the example of a large electronic commerce store (like Amazon), where one of the primary requirement is that any user transaction should never be canceled due to a failure of the machine that is running that transaction. For instance, if a user has added an item to their shopping cart, the system is expected not to lose it. A reliable distributed system achieves this through redundancy of both the software components and data. If the server carrying the user’s shopping cart fails, another server that has the exact replica of the shopping cart should replace it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, redundancy has a cost and a reliable system has to pay that to achieve such resilience for services by eliminating every single point of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Availability\n",
    "**Availability** is the time a system remains operational to perform its required function in a specific period. It is a simple measure of the percentage of time that a system, service, or a machine remains operational under normal conditions. An aircraft that can be flown for many hours a month without much downtime can be said to have a high availability. Availability takes into account maintainability, repair time, spares availability, and other logistics considerations. If an aircraft is down for maintenance, it is considered not available during that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability is availability over time considering the full range of possible real-world conditions that can occur. An aircraft that can make it through any possible weather safely is more reliable than one that has vulnerabilities to possible conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reliability Vs. Availability\n",
    "If a system is reliable, it is available. However, if it is available, it is not necessarily reliable. In other words, high reliability contributes to high availability, but it is possible to achieve a high availability even with an unreliable product by minimizing repair time and ensuring that spares are always available when they are needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take the example of an online retail store that has 99.99% availability for the first two years after its launch. However, the system was launched without any information security testing. The customers are happy with the system, but they don’t realize that it isn’t very reliable as it is vulnerable to likely risks. In the third year, the system experiences a series of information security incidents that suddenly result in extremely low availability for extended periods of time. This results in reputational and financial damage to the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency \n",
    "To understand how to measure the **efficiency** of a distributed system, let’s assume we have an operation that runs in a distributed manner and delivers a set of items as result. Two standard measures of its efficiency are the **response time** (or **latency**) that denotes the delay to obtain the first item and the **throughput** (or **bandwidth**) which denotes the number of items delivered in a given time unit (e.g., a second). The two measures correspond to the following unit costs:\n",
    "- Number of messages globally sent by the nodes of the system regardless of the message size.\n",
    "- Size of messages representing the volume of data exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of operations supported by distributed data structures (e.g., searching for a specific key in a distributed index) can be characterized as a function of one of these cost units. Generally speaking, the analysis of a distributed structure in terms of ‘number of messages’ is over-simplistic. It ignores the impact of many aspects, including the network topology, the network load, and its variation, the possible heterogeneity of the software and hardware components involved in data processing and routing, etc. However, it is quite difficult to develop a precise cost model that would accurately take into account all these performance factors; therefore, we have to live with rough but robust estimates of the system behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serviceability or Manageability\n",
    "Another important consideration while designing a distributed system is how easy it is to operate and maintain. **Serviceability** or **manageability** is the simplicity andpeed with which a system can be repaired or maintained; if the time to fix a failed system increases, then availability wil sl decrease. Things to consider for manageability are the ease of diagnosing and understanding problems when they occur, ease of making updates or modifications, and how simple the system is to operate (i.e., does it routinely operate without failure or exceptions?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Early detection of faults can decrease or avoid system downtime. For example, some enterprise systems can automatically call a service center (without human intervention) when the system experiences a system fault.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virtual Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "A **VM** is a form of computer inside of a computer. It is a program that we run on a machine that completely emulates a new **kernel** and **operating system**. Very useful when isolating programs from one another while having them share the same physical machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Worker Pool Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the **Task Queue Pattern**. In this design, a pool of **workers**, usually themselves servers, take tasks off of a single shared queue and process those tasks independently. In order to ensure that every task gets done at least once despite potential partitions between queue and workers, the workers must confirm the status of the task after it is done (usually **success** or **failure**)."

    "* **Consistency ( C )**: All nodes see the same data at the same time. It is equivalent to having a single up-to-date copy of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Availability ( A )**: Every request received by a non-failing node in the system must result in a response. Even when severe network failures occur, every request must terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Partition tolerance ( P )**: A partition-tolerant system continues to operate despite partial system failure or arbitrary message loss. Such a system can sustain any network failure that does not result in a failure of the entire network. Data is sufficiently replicated across combinations of nodes and networks to keep the system up through intermittent outages.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the CAP theorem, any distributed system needs to pick two out of the three properties. The three options are **CA**, **CP**, and **AP**. However, CA is not really a coherent option, as a system that is not partition-tolerant will be forced to give up either Consistency or Availability in the case of a network partition. Therefore, the theorem can really be stated as: In the presence of a network partition, a distributed system must choose either **Consistency** or **Availability**.\n",

We can only build a system that has any two of these three properties. Because, to be consistent, all nodes should see the same set of updates in the same order. But if the network loses a partition, updates in one partition might not make it to the other partitions before a client reads from the out-of-date partition after having read from the up-to-date one. The only thing that can be done to cope with this possibility is to stop serving requests from the out-of-date partition, but then the service is no longer 100% available."

    "**Data partitioning** is a technique to break up a big database (DB) into many smaller parts. It is the process of splitting up a DB/table across multiple machines to improve the manageability, performance, availability, and load balancing of an application. The justification for data partitioning is that, after a certain scale point, it is cheaper and more feasible to scale horizontally by adding more machines than to grow it vertically by adding beefier servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partitioning Methods\n",
    "There are many different schemes one could use to decide how to break up an application database into multiple smaller DBs. Below are three of the most popular schemes used by various large scale applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Horizontal partitioning**: In this scheme, we put different rows into different tables. For example, if we are storing different places in a table, we can decide that locations with ZIP codes less than 10000 are stored in one table and places with ZIP codes greater than 10000 are stored in a separate table. This is also called a **range based partitioning** as we are storing different ranges of data in separate tables. Horizontal partitioning is also called as **Data Sharding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key problem with this approach is that if the value whose range is used for partitioning isn’t chosen carefully, then the partitioning scheme will lead to unbalanced servers. In the previous example, splitting location based on their zip codes assumes that places will be evenly distributed across the different zip codes. This assumption is not valid as there will be a lot of places in a thickly populated area like Manhattan as compared to its suburb cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vertical Partitioning**: In this scheme, we divide our data to store tables related to a specific feature in their own server. For example, if we are building Instagram like application - where we need to store data related to users, photos they upload, and people they follow - we can decide to place user profile information on one DB server, friend lists on another, and photos on a third server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertical partitioning is straightforward to implement and has a low impact on the application. The main problem with this approach is that if our application experiences additional growth, then it may be necessary to further partition a feature specific DB across various servers (e.g. it would not be possible for a single server to handle all the metadata queries for 10 billion photos by 140 million users).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Directory Based Partitioning**: A loosely coupled approach to work around issues mentioned in the above schemes is to create a lookup service which knows our current partitioning scheme and abstracts it away from the DB access code. So, to find out where a particular data entity resides, we query the directory server that holds the mapping between each tuple key to its DB server. This loosely coupled approach means we can perform tasks like adding servers to the DB pool or changing our partitioning scheme without having an impact on the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partitioning Criteria\n",
    "**Key or Hash-based partitioning**: Under this scheme, we apply a hash function to some key attributes of the entity we are storing; that yields the partition number. For example, if we have `100 DB servers` and our `ID` is a numeric value that gets incremented by one each time a new record is inserted. In this example, the hash function could be `ID % 100`, which will give us the server number where we can store/read that record. This approach should ensure a uniform allocation of data among servers. The fundamental problem with this approach is that it effectively fixes the total number of DB servers, since adding new servers means changing the hash function which would require redistribution of data and downtime for the service. A workaround for this problem is to use **Consistent Hashing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**List partitioning**: In this scheme, each partition is assigned a list of values, so whenever we want to insert a new record, we will see which partition contains our key and then store it there. For example, we can decide all users living in Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, or Denmark will be stored in a partition for the Nordic countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Round-robin partitioning**: This is a very simple strategy that ensures uniform data distribution. With `n` partitions, the `i` tuple is assigned to partition (`i mod n`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composite partitioning**: Under this scheme, we combine any of the above partitioning schemes to devise a new scheme. For example, first applying a list partitioning scheme and then a hash based partitioning. Consistent hashing could be considered a composite of hash and list partitioning where the hash reduces the key space to a size that can be listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Problems of Data Partitioning\n",
    "On a partitioned database, there are certain extra constraints on the different operations that can be performed. Most of these constraints are due to the fact that operations across multiple tables or multiple rows in the same table will no longer run on the same server. Below are some of the constraints and additional complexities introduced by partitioning:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Joins and Denormalization**: Performing joins on a database which is running on one server is straightforward, but once a database is partitioned and spread across multiple machines it is often not feasible to perform joins that span database partitions. Such joins will not be performance efficient since data has to be compiled from multiple servers. A common workaround for this problem is to denormalize the database so that queries that previously required joins can be performed from a single table. Of course, the service now has to deal with all the perils of denormalization such as data inconsistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Referential integrity**: Performing a cross-partition query on a partitioned database is not feasible, similarly, trying to enforce data integrity constraints such as foreign keys in a partitioned database can be extremely difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of RDBMS do not support foreign keys constraints across databases on different database servers. Which means that applications that require referential integrity on partitioned databases often have to enforce it in application code. Often in such cases, applications have to run regular SQL jobs to clean up dangling references.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rebalancing**: There could be many reasons we have to change our partitioning scheme:\n",
    "* The data distribution is not uniform, e.g., there are a lot of places for a particular ZIP code that cannot fit into one database partition.\n",
    "* There is a lot of load on a partition, e.g., there are too many requests being handled by the DB partition dedicated to user photos.\n",
    "In such cases, either we have to create more DB partitions or have to rebalance existing partitions, which means the partitioning scheme changed and all existing data moved to new locations. Doing this without incurring downtime is extremely difficult. Using a scheme like directory based partitioning does make rebalancing a more palatable experience at the cost of increasing the complexity of the system and creating a new single point of failure (i.e. the lookup service/database)."

    "<img src='imgs/ch2.png' alt='ch2' width=500 height=500>\n",
    "\n",

For example, when a node is removed, the next node becomes responsible for all of the keys stored on the outgoing node. However, this scheme can result in **non-uniform data and load distribution**. This problem can be solved with the help of **Virtual nodes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virtual nodes\n",
    "Adding and removing nodes in any distributed system is quite common. Existing nodes can die and may need to be decommissioned. Similarly, new nodes may be added to an existing cluster to meet growing demands. To efficiently handle these scenarios, Consistent Hashing makes use of **virtual nodes** (or **Vnodes**).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw above, the basic Consistent Hashing algorithm assigns a single token (or a consecutive hash range) to each physical node. This was a static division of ranges that requires calculating tokens based on a given number of nodes. This scheme made adding or replacing a node an expensive operation, as, in this case, we would like to rebalance and distribute the data to all other nodes, resulting in moving a lot of data. Here are a few potential issues associated with a manual and fixed division of the ranges:\n",
    "* **Adding or removing nodes**: Adding or removing nodes will result in recomputing the tokens causing a significant administrative overhead for a large cluster.\n",
    "* **Hotspots**: Since each node is assigned one large range, if the data is not evenly distributed, some nodes can become hotspots.\n",
    "* **Node rebuilding**: Since each node’s data might be replicated (for fault-tolerance) on a fixed number of other nodes, when we need to rebuild a node, only its replica nodes can provide the data. This puts a lot of pressure on the replica nodes and can lead to service degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle these issues, Consistent Hashing introduces a new scheme of distributing the tokens to physical nodes. Instead of assigning a single token to a node, the hash range is divided into multiple smaller ranges, and each physical node is assigned several of these smaller ranges. Each of these subranges is considered a **Vnode**. With Vnodes, instead of a node being responsible for just one token, it is responsible for many tokens (or subranges).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='imgs/vn1.png' alt='vn1' width=600 height=500>\n",

When a new node is added, it receives many Vnodes from the existing nodes to maintain a balanced cluster. Similarly, when a node needs to be rebuilt, instead of getting data from a fixed number of replicas, many nodes participate in the rebuild process.\n",

    "To ensure highly available and durability, Consistent Hashing replicates each data item on multiple `N` nodes in the system where the value `N` is equivalent to the **replication factor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The replication factor is the number of nodes that will receive the copy of the same data. For example, a replication factor of two means there are two copies of each data item, where each copy is stored on a different node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each key is assigned to a **coordinator node** (generally the first node that falls in the hash range), which first stores the data locally and then replicates it to `N−1` clockwise **successor nodes** on the ring. This results in each node owning the region on the ring between it and its `Nth` predecessor. In an **eventually consistent system**, this replication is done **asynchronously** (in the background).\n",
    "\n",
    "In eventually consistent systems, copies of data don’t always have to be identical as long as they are designed to eventually become consistent. **In distributed systems, eventual consistency is used to achieve high availability**.\n",

    "<img src='imgs/ch5.png' alt='ch5' width=500 height=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent Hashing helps with efficiently partitioning and replicating data; therefore, any distributed system that needs to scale up or down or wants to achieve high availability through data replication can utilize Consistent Hashing. A few such examples could be:\n",
    "* Any system working with a set of storage (or database) servers and needs to scale up or down based on the usage, e.g., the system could need more storage during Christmas because of high traffic.\n",
    "* Any distributed system that needs dynamic adjustment of its cache usage by adding or removing cache servers based on the traffic load.\n",
    "* Any system that wants to replicate its data shards to achieve high availability.\n",
